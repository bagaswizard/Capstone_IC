## How it works

Interface with ds18b20 and sends the data through uart

## How to test

1. Connect the ds18b20 sensor to your device as described in the hardware section.
2. Power on the device and ensure the UART connection is properly configured.
3. Run the main application code.
4. Observe the UART output for temperature readings from the ds18b20 sensor.
5. Verify that the readings update as the temperature changes.
   
## External hardware

There is ds18b20 sensor and micro usb port for uart
